# You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. 
# A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

# We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
# Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. 
# It can be proven that the answer is unique.

 

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abbaca"
# Output: "ca"
# Explanation: 
# For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and 
# equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the 
# string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
